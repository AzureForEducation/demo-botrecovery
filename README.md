# Demo - Proactively Engaging Students

## What is this is about?

This demo does simulate a "course evaluation process" and its possible engagement triggered automatically by the system based on the responses received from the student's side, once they're the ones in charge for answering that.

This repository groups a multi-faceted demo which was designed to show to EDU's customers one (among various others) feasible way to proactively engage both K-12 and HigherEd institutions with its students using Microsoft Cloud and enclosed technologies for that.

This demo is a connected puzzle, meaning that we are using different technologies available on Microsoft Cloud (Azure and Office 365) to build it. Ideally, it would be best if you presented all the pieces together. However, you should be able to perform parts of it separately as well.

## Why is this demo so cool?

This demo shows an automated way to engage with students using technologies that differentiate Microsoft's cloud and services from its competitors: Cognitive Services, Azure Functions, Office 365 Forms, Office 365 Flow, SQL Server PaaS among others.

By doing this, you would be able to demonstrate how O365 and Azure can be used together to complement themselves in a real scenario. Besides that, this demo presents different aspects and technologies separately, giving an idea about what is possible by using each service individually.

## When you should present this out?

This demo is ideal if you're targeting to present something real on the following scenarios:
